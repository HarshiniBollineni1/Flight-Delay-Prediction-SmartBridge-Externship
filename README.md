Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is designed to create a Flight Delay Prediction System using Machine Learning, with a straightforward aim to help airlines, passengers, and stakeholders make informed decisions regarding flight delays. The process starts with building and testing a predictive model using historical flight data. We then compare different models to find the most accurate one.The key significance of this project lies in its potential to provide practical benefits. By integrating the best-performing machine learning model into a user-friendly web application using Flask, Users input relevant flight information, and the integrated model processes this data to provide predictions regarding potential delays and expected arrival times.This user-friendly tool empowers airlines, passengers, and stakeholders to take proactive actions based on anticipated delays, improving overall travel experiences.
